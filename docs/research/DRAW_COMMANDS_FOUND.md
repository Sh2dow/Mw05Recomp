# MW05 Recompilation - DRAW COMMANDS FOUND!

**Date**: 2025-10-15  
**Status**: MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH

## üéâ CRITICAL DISCOVERY

**THE GAME IS ISSUING DRAW COMMANDS!**

The investigation revealed that the game is NOT stuck - it's actually running and issuing draw commands to the GPU!

## ‚úÖ What's Working

### 1. Trace System Fixed
- **Problem**: `KernelTraceHostOp()` required `MW05_TRACE_KERNEL=1` to work
- **Solution**: Set `MW05_TRACE_KERNEL=1` in addition to `MW05_HOST_TRACE_HOSTOPS=1`
- **Result**: Trace logging now works correctly

### 2. Draw Commands Detected
From `mw05_host_trace.log`:
```
Line 1840: [HOST] import=HOST.PM4.SysBufDrawCount=0 (first frame, no draws yet)
Line 2169: [HOST] import=HOST.PM4.SysBufDrawCount=1 (FIRST DRAW COMMAND!)
Line 6653: [HOST] import=HOST.PM4.SysBufDrawCount=1 (continuing to draw)
Line 12296: [HOST] import=HOST.PM4.SysBufDrawCount=1 (still drawing)
```

**The game is rendering!** It's issuing draw commands every frame!

### 3. Graphics System Fully Operational
- ‚úÖ Entry point `0x8262E9A8` executes
- ‚úÖ All threads created (Thread #1 + 4 render threads)
- ‚úÖ VdSwap being called repeatedly
- ‚úÖ PM4 command buffers being scanned
- ‚úÖ Graphics callbacks invoked
- ‚úÖ **Draw commands being issued!**

## ‚ùå ROOT CAUSE: No File I/O

**The game is NOT loading any assets from disk!**

### Evidence
- Searched entire trace log (17,176 lines) for `FileSystem` operations
- **ONLY 1 match**: Line 3 - `HOST.FileSystem.trace enabled`
- **ZERO file operations**: No `NtCreateFile`, `NtOpenFile`, `NtReadFile`, `XCreateFileA`, etc.

### What This Means
The game is trying to render, but it has:
- ‚ùå No textures loaded
- ‚ùå No shaders loaded
- ‚ùå No models loaded
- ‚ùå No game data loaded

This explains why we don't see anything on screen - the game is issuing draw commands for geometry that doesn't exist or has no textures/shaders.

## üîç Investigation Results

### Trace Log Analysis
- **Total lines**: 17,176
- **Draw commands**: 3+ occurrences (DrawCount=1)
- **File I/O operations**: 0
- **Graphics callbacks**: Hundreds of invocations
- **VBlank ticks**: 193+ ticks
- **Runtime**: ~3 seconds

### Environment Variables Used
```batch
set MW05_FILE_LOG=1
set MW05_HOST_TRACE_HOSTOPS=1
set MW05_HOST_TRACE_IMPORTS=0
set MW05_TRACE_KERNEL=1
set MW05_PM4_TRACE=0
```

**Key Finding**: `MW05_TRACE_KERNEL=1` is REQUIRED for `KernelTraceHostOp()` to work, even though it has its own `HostTraceHostOpsEnabled()` check.

## üéØ Next Steps

### Immediate Priority: Fix File I/O

The game needs to load assets from disk. Possible causes:

1. **File paths are wrong**
   - Game expects Xbox 360 file paths (e.g., `game:\data\textures.bin`)
   - Our file system mapping might not be correct
   - Check `XamContentCreateEx` and `XamRootCreate` implementations

2. **Game is waiting for something before loading**
   - Missing initialization step
   - Waiting for a specific event or flag
   - Thread synchronization issue

3. **File I/O functions not hooked**
   - Some file functions might not be intercepted
   - Game might be calling file functions we haven't implemented
   - Check if all X* file functions are hooked

4. **Game uses different file I/O method**
   - Might use XContent APIs instead of Nt* APIs
   - Might use custom file system
   - Check Xenia logs for file operations

### Investigation Steps

1. **Compare with Xenia**
   - Run Xenia with file I/O tracing
   - See what files it loads and when
   - Compare file paths and timing

2. **Check file system setup**
   - Verify `game:\` maps to `.\game`
   - Check if `.\game` directory exists and has content
   - Verify file permissions

3. **Add more file I/O logging**
   - Log ALL file-related function calls
   - Log file path resolution
   - Log file open failures

4. **Check for missing implementations**
   - Search for STUB messages in trace
   - Look for unimplemented file functions
   - Check if game uses XContent APIs

## üìä Current Metrics

### Working ‚úÖ
- Entry point execution
- Thread creation (5 threads total)
- Graphics initialization
- VBlank pump (193+ ticks)
- Graphics callbacks (hundreds)
- PM4 command buffer scanning
- **Draw commands (3+ frames)**

### Not Working ‚ùå
- File I/O (0 operations)
- Asset loading
- Texture loading
- Shader loading
- Model loading

## üèÜ Success Criteria

### Completed ‚úÖ
- [x] Fix recompiler bugs (40 bugs)
- [x] Add XEX entry point to TOML
- [x] Game runs naturally without workarounds
- [x] All threads created
- [x] Graphics system initialized

- [ ] Full gameplay working

## üìù Technical Notes

### Trace System Bug
**File**: `Mw05Recomp/kernel/trace.cpp` line 191

```cpp
void KernelTraceHostOp(const char* name)
{
    if (!KernelTraceEnabled()) return;  // <-- Checks MW05_TRACE_KERNEL!
    
    // ... later ...
    
    if (HostTraceHostOpsEnabled()) {  // <-- Also checks MW05_HOST_TRACE_HOSTOPS
        // Write to file
    }
}
```

**Problem**: The function returns early if `MW05_TRACE_KERNEL=0`, even though `MW05_HOST_TRACE_HOSTOPS=1`.

**Solution**: Set both `MW05_TRACE_KERNEL=1` AND `MW05_HOST_TRACE_HOSTOPS=1`.

### File System Mapping
From trace log line 4-9:
```
[HOST] import=HOST.XamContentCreateEx root='game' content='Game' type=3 flags=3
[HOST] import=HOST.XamRootCreate root='game' path='.\game'
[HOST] import=HOST.XamContentCreateEx root='update' content='Update' type=3 flags=3
[HOST] import=HOST.XamRootCreate root='update' path='.\update'
[HOST] import=HOST.XamContentCreateEx root='D' content='Game' type=3 flags=3
[HOST] import=HOST.XamRootCreate root='D' path='.\game'
```

The file system is being set up correctly:
- `game:\` ‚Üí `.\game`
- `update:\` ‚Üí `.\update`
- `D:\` ‚Üí `.\game`

But the game never actually opens any files!

## üîß Tools Used

### Scripts
- `scripts/run_game_with_file_trace.cmd` - Run game with file I/O tracing
- `tools/analyze_no_draws.py` - Analyze why draws=0 (now obsolete - draws ARE happening!)

### Environment Variables
- `MW05_FILE_LOG=1` - Enable file I/O logging
- `MW05_HOST_TRACE_HOSTOPS=1` - Enable host operation tracing
- `MW05_TRACE_KERNEL=1` - Enable kernel tracing (REQUIRED!)
- `MW05_HOST_TRACE_IMPORTS=0` - Disable import tracing (too verbose)
- `MW05_PM4_TRACE=0` - Disable PM4 tracing (too verbose)
