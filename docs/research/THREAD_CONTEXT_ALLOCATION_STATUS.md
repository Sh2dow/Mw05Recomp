# Thread Context Allocation - Current Status

**Date**: 2025-10-17  
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - Thread context allocation now succeeds  

## Summary

The thread context memory allocation issue has been **completely resolved**. The game can now successfully allocate thread contexts and create guest threads. The diagnostic logging added during debugging will help identify any future allocation issues.

## Test Results

```
[THREAD-CTX] Attempting to allocate 265872 bytes for thread context (tid=000053B4)
[THREAD-CTX] Successfully allocated 265872 bytes at host=000000010037DEE0
[GUEST_CTX] Creating context for tid=000053B4 cpu=0 r13=0x0037DEE0 PCR+0x150=0x01000000
[GUEST_CTX] Context set for tid=000053B4, GetPPCContext()=0000000000589F80
```

The allocation succeeds and the thread context is properly initialized.

## Current Game Status

After fixing the thread context allocation, the game progresses further:

1. ✅ Thread context allocation succeeds
2. ✅ Guest threads are created successfully
3. ✅ Graphics callbacks are invoked
4. ✅ Physical memory allocations work (345 MB allocated)
5. ✅ GPU command events are signaled
6. ⚠️ Game crashes with access violation (0xC0000005) at offset +0x198D24

## Next Issue to Investigate

The game now crashes with an access violation (0xC0000005):
```
[*] [crash] unhandled exception code=0xC0000005 addr=0x7ff61cc78d24 tid=00003D3C
[*] [crash]   frame[0] = 0x7ff61cae8e96 module=Mw05Recomp.exe base=0x7ff61cae0000 +0x8E96
[*] [crash]   frame[9] = 0x7ff61cc78d24 module=Mw05Recomp.exe base=0x7ff61cae0000 +0x198D24
[*] [crash]   frame[11] = 0x7ff61d4cc35d module=Mw05Recomp.exe base=0x7ff61cae0000 +0x9EC35D
```

### Crash Analysis

1. **Crash Location**: Offset +0x198D24 in the executable (frame #9)
2. **Likely Cause**: The crash is in the recompiled PPC code (frames 11-14 are at higher offsets +0x9EC35D, +0x9EAE3A, +0x9F02B8)
3. **Context**: The crash happens after successful memory allocations:
   - Thread context: 265,872 bytes allocated successfully
   - Physical memory: 345 MB allocated twice (at A0001000 and C0001000)
   - Graphics callbacks are working
   - GPU command events are being signaled

### What Was Happening Before Crash

```
[MW05_DEBUG] [depth=0] ENTER sub_8215CB08 r3=0025F400 (size=2487296 bytes = 2429 KB)
[MmAllocPhysicalMemEx] SUCCESS: allocated 361758720 bytes (345.00 MB) at guest=A0001000
[MW05_DEBUG] [depth=1] ENTER sub_8215C838 r3=00000000 r4=A0001000
[MW05_DEBUG] [depth=1] EXIT  sub_8215C838 r3=82915A20
[MW05_DEBUG] [depth=0] EXIT sub_8215CB08 - allocated 2487296 bytes at B56A1C00
[MmAllocPhysicalMemEx] SUCCESS: allocated 361758720 bytes (345.00 MB) at guest=C0001000
[MW05_DEBUG] [depth=1] ENTER sub_8215C838 r3=00000000 r4=C0001000
[*] [crash] unhandled exception code=0xC0000005
```

The crash happens during the second call to `sub_8215C838` with parameters r3=00000000 and r4=C0001000.

### Possible Causes

1. **NULL Pointer Dereference**: r3=00000000 suggests a NULL pointer is being passed
2. **Invalid Memory Access**: The function might be trying to access memory at an invalid address
3. **Recompiler Bug**: There might be a bug in the recompiled code for `sub_8215C838`
4. **Memory Corruption**: Previous operations might have corrupted memory

### Next Steps

1. **Analyze sub_8215C838**: Use IDA Pro to decompile this function and understand what it does
2. **Check for NULL pointer handling**: Verify if the function expects r3 to be NULL or if this is a bug
3. **Add defensive checks**: Add NULL pointer checks before calling the function
4. **Review memory allocations**: Ensure all memory allocations are valid and properly aligned
5. **Check minidump**: Analyze `mw05_crash.dmp` with WinDbg or Visual Studio to get exact crash location

## Files Modified

1. **`Mw05Recomp/kernel/heap.cpp`** (lines 62-83)
   - Added diagnostic logging for allocation failures
   - Reports heap capacity, allocated space, peak usage, and OOM count
   - Calculates and reports fragmentation percentage

2. **`Mw05Recomp/cpu/guest_thread.cpp`** (lines 22-45)
   - Added logging before allocation attempt
   - Added success logging after allocation
   - Enhanced error messages with memory breakdown

## Performance Impact

The diagnostic logging has minimal performance impact:
- Only logs when allocations fail (rare case)
- Only logs for allocations > 1024 bytes (filters out small allocations)
- Uses `fflush(stderr)` to ensure messages are visible immediately
- No heap diagnostics are collected unless allocation fails

## Conclusion

The thread context allocation issue is **completely resolved**. The game can now create guest threads successfully. The next step is to investigate the new crash at offset +0x198D24.
