# MW05 PM4 Diagnostic Summary

## Executive Summary
**ROOT CAUSE**: Game is stuck in initialization phase - issuing ONLY register writes (TYPE0), NO command packets (TYPE3).

## PM4 Packet Statistics

### Packet Type Breakdown
- **TYPE0 (Register Writes)**: 2,906,117 packets (100%)
- **TYPE1 (Reserved)**: 0 packets
- **TYPE2 (Reserved)**: 0 packets
- **TYPE3 (Commands)**: 0 packets ❌
- **Draw Commands**: 0 ❌

### What This Means
- TYPE0 packets set up GPU state (viewport, render targets, shaders, etc.)
- TYPE3 packets issue commands (draws, clears, indirect buffers, etc.)
- A working game needs BOTH types - we only have TYPE0
- This indicates the game is stuck in initialization, not rendering

## Ring Buffer Configuration

### Ring Buffer Status: ✅ INITIALIZED
```
Base Address: 0x00040300
Size (log2):  16
Size (bytes): 65,536 (64KB)
Status:       Initialized and being scanned
```

### System Command Buffer Status: ✅ INITIALIZED
```
Base Address: 0x00020300
Size (bytes): 65,536 (64KB)
Status:       Initialized and being scanned
```

## Scanning Activity

### Ring Buffer Scans
- Scans per VdSwap: 1 (automatic)
- Packets scanned per swap: ~4,096
- Total scans: ~700 (over 23 seconds)
- Result: Only TYPE0 packets found

### System Buffer Scans
- Scans per VdSwap: 1 (automatic)
- Result: Only TYPE0 packets found

## File Loading Status

### Files Loaded: ✅ WORKING
```
File: GLOBALMEMORYFILE.BIN
Size: 6,292,096 bytes (6 MB)
Read: 4,194,304 bytes (4 MB, capped at max read size)
Status: Successfully loaded
```

### Comparison with Xenia
- Xenia: 3 file I/O operations
- Us: 1 file loaded
- Conclusion: File loading is NOT the bottleneck

## VBlank Activity

### VBlank Ticks: ✅ WORKING
```
Total ticks: 1,401
Duration: ~23 seconds (1401/60 fps)
Frequency: 60 Hz
Status: Working correctly
```

## Graphics Callback

### Graphics Notify Callback: ❌ NOT INVOKED
```
Registered: Yes (at 0x825979A8)
Invoked: No
Reason: Game hasn't issued any draw commands yet
```

## Hypothesis: Why No TYPE3 Packets?

### Possible Causes (in order of likelihood)

1. **Game Waiting for Resource Loading** (MOST LIKELY)
   - Game may be waiting for more files to load
   - Streaming system may be stalled
   - Missing file or resource preventing progression

2. **Missing Kernel Function**
   - Game may be calling a stub that returns failure
   - Initialization sequence blocked on missing functionality
   - Check for STUB messages in stderr

3. **Thread Synchronization Issue**
   - Render thread may be blocked waiting for another thread
   - Worker threads may not be running
   - Check thread states and sleep patterns

4. **Graphics Initialization Incomplete**
   - Game may be waiting for GPU initialization to complete
   - Missing Vd* function preventing progression
   - Check VdInitializeEngines and related calls

5. **Game Logic Bug**
   - Recompiler bug causing game to skip rendering code
   - Control flow error in initialization sequence
   - Would require deep debugging with IDA

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. ✅ Check if ring buffer is initialized (DONE - it is!)
2. ⏭️ Enable TYPE0 register tracing to see what state is being set up
3. ⏭️ Check for STUB messages indicating missing functions
4. ⏭️ Compare thread activity with Xenia
5. ⏭️ Check if game is waiting on file I/O or other blocking operations

### Diagnostic Commands
```powershell
# Enable TYPE0 register tracing
$env:MW05_PM4_TRACE_REGS = "1"
$env:MW05_PM4_TRACE_REG_BUDGET = "500"

# Check for missing functions
Get-Content debug_stderr.txt | Select-String "STUB|!!!"

# Check thread activity
Get-Content mw05_host_trace.log | Select-String "Thread|Sleep"

# Compare with Xenia
Get-Content tools/xenia.log | Select-String "TYPE3|DRAW"
```

### Long-term Investigation
1. Compare PM4 register writes with Xenia to see if state setup matches
2. Check if game is stuck in a wait loop (KeDelayExecutionThread spam)
3. Verify all Vd* graphics functions are implemented
4. Check if streaming system is working correctly
5. Look for missing imports that might block initialization

## Conclusion

The game is running and initializing graphics state (2.9M register writes), but has NOT started issuing draw commands. This is NOT a PM4 parser bug or ring buffer issue - the infrastructure is working correctly. The problem is that the game logic is stuck in initialization and hasn't progressed to the rendering phase.

**Key Insight**: We need to find out WHY the game isn't progressing from initialization to rendering. This requires investigating:
- Missing kernel functions (check STUB messages)
- Thread synchronization (check if render thread is blocked)
- Resource loading (check if game is waiting for files)
- Graphics initialization (check if Vd* functions are complete)
