# 🧠 GPU Writeback Implementation — Summary

## ✅ What We've Accomplished

Implemented **GPU Writeback Updates** in `ProcessMW05Queue()`:

* 🌀 **Ring Buffer Read Pointer Writeback** (`g_RbWriteBackPtr`)
  → Updated after processing commands
* 🔁 **GPU Identifier Writeback** (`g_VdSystemCommandBufferGpuIdAddr`)
  → Incremented to signal progress
* 📜 **Logs confirm** both writebacks are functioning correctly

---

## 🧩 Writeback Infrastructure

* Added accessor functions in `imports.cpp`:

  ```cpp
  GetRbWriteBackPtr();
  GetVdSystemCommandBufferGpuIdAddr();
  ```
* These safely access **atomic writeback pointers** from `mw05_trace_shims.cpp`
* ✅ Confirmed functional during diagnostic runs

## 🧪 Confirmed Working

| Component               | Status | Notes                                   |
| ----------------------- | ------ | --------------------------------------- |
| Queue processing        | ✅      | Commands processed normally             |
| PM4 opcode 04 detection | ✅      | Counter reaches at least **14**         |
| Writeback updates       | ✅      | e.g., `0x000402F0: 0000FFF0 → 00040450` |
| GPU ID incrementing     | ✅      | e.g., `0x000402F8: 000000B4 → 000000B5` |
| Ready bit               | ✅      | Set after each batch                    |

## ❌ Remaining Issue

Despite correct writebacks, **MW05 is not submitting new commands** after the initial batch.

* Queue remains **stalled**:

  ```text
  qhead = 00140450
  qtail = 00140450
  ```
* Queue stays empty throughout the entire 120-second run.

---

## 🔍 Possible Causes

1. ⚠️ **Incorrect writeback pointer value**

    * Currently writing `new_qhead` to the ring buffer writeback
    * MW05 might expect:

        * A **relative offset**
        * A **wrapped value**
        * Or a **different address space**

2. 🚨 **Missing fence or interrupt**

    * MW05 could be waiting on a **GPU fence completion** or **interrupt signal**
      not yet provided by the host

3. 🧱 **Command execution not occurring**

    * `PM4_ScanLinear()` may **parse** commands but not **execute** them
    * MW05 might detect "no progress" as a result

4. 📦 **Asset loading blocked**

    * Game could be waiting for **file I/O** or **texture streaming**

5. 🎮 **User input required**

    * MW05 might pause on a **splash/menu screen** awaiting input
      (e.g., `Press Start`)

## 🚀 Next Step

The **writeback mechanism is implemented and verified** ✅
Now, investigate **why MW05 isn't progressing** after receiving valid writeback signals.
