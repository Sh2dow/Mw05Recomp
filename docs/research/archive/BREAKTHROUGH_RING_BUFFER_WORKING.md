# Breakthrough: Ring Buffer Working!

**Date**: 2025-10-14

## Summary
Major breakthrough - PM4 ring buffer is now being scanned and processing commands! This was achieved after fixing the VdSwap shim.

## The Problem
Early investigation showed VdSwap was being called, but PM4_ScanLinear was returning 0 (no packets consumed). The issue was:

```
[VdSwap] pWriteCur=0x00000004 (INVALID!)
GuestOffsetInRange check FAILED
PM4_ScanLinear skipped
```

The write cursor pointer was invalid (0x00000004), causing the range check to fail and skip scanning.

## The Fix
**File**: `Mw05Recomp/kernel/imports.cpp`

Changed the shim for `sub_82595FC8` from a stub to calling the original recompiled function:

```cpp
// OLD (WRONG):
PPC_FUNC_IMPL(__imp__sub_82595FC8) {
    // Stub - just return
    return;
}

// NEW (CORRECT):
PPC_FUNC_IMPL(__imp__sub_82595FC8) {
    // Call the original recompiled function
    sub_82595FC8(ctx, base);
}
```

## The Result
After the fix:

```
[VdSwap] pWriteCur=0x000202E0 (VALID!)
GuestOffsetInRange=1 (PASS!)
PM4_OnRingBufferWrite invoked
PM4_ScanLinear result: consumed=24 packets
```

## Ring Buffer Details
- **Base address**: 0x000202E0
- **Size**: 64 KiB (65,536 bytes)
- **Write-back pointer**: Set correctly
- **Packets scanned**: 24+ per frame

## PM4 Packet Types Detected
- **TYPE0**: Register writes (GPU state setup)
- **TYPE3**: GPU commands (NOP, other non-draw commands)
- **NO DRAWS YET**: Still no 0x22 (DRAW_INDX) or 0x36 (DRAW_INDX_2)

## Why This Was Important
This confirmed:
1. The PM4 command buffer infrastructure was working
2. VdSwap was receiving valid parameters
3. The game was writing commands to the ring buffer
4. We just needed to wait for the game to issue draw commands

## Opcode Histogram (at the time)
```
Opcode 0x00 (NOP): 15 packets
Opcode 0x10 (REG_WRITE): 9 packets
```

No draw opcodes yet - game was still in initialization phase.

## Next Steps (at the time)
1. Continue monitoring for appearance of 0x22/0x36 opcodes
2. Verify all worker threads are created (file I/O depends on this)
3. Check if game needs to load shaders/textures before drawing
4. Compare with Xenia timeline to see when first draw appears
