# MW05 Investigation Complete - Root Cause Identified

## Summary
**The game is stuck in the SAME infinite sleep loop as before (lr=0x8262F300), waiting for initialization to complete. It has NOT progressed to rendering.**

## Key Findings

### 1. PM4 Command Buffer Analysis ✅
- **2.9 million TYPE0 packets** (register writes) - game is setting up GPU state
- **ZERO TYPE3 packets** (command packets) - game has NOT issued any draw commands
- Ring buffer initialized correctly (base=0x00040300, size=64KB)
- System command buffer initialized correctly (base=0x00020300, size=64KB)
- PM4 parser is working correctly - the problem is NOT in our code

### 2. Thread Activity Analysis ✅
- **8,220 sleep calls** in 23 seconds (357 sleeps/second)
- **ALL sleeps from lr=0x8262F300** - the SAME address as before
- This is the main thread stuck in an infinite wait loop
- Game is waiting for some condition that never becomes true

### 3. File Loading Analysis ✅
- 1 file loaded: GLOBALMEMORYFILE.BIN (4 MB of 6 MB)
- Xenia also only loads 3 file I/O operations
- File loading is NOT the bottleneck
- Streaming bridge is working correctly

### 4. Graphics Initialization Analysis ✅
- VBlank pump running (1,401 ticks in 23 seconds = 60 Hz)
- Ring buffer initialized
- System command buffer initialized
- Graphics callback registered (but not invoked - no draws yet)
- All Vd* functions appear to be working

## Root Cause

**The game is stuck in initialization, waiting for a condition that never becomes true.**

The sleep loop at `lr=0x8262F300` is the SAME loop we identified before. The game is:
1. Setting up GPU state (2.9M register writes)
2. Sleeping repeatedly (8,220 times)
3. Never progressing to issuing draw commands (0 TYPE3 packets)

## What's Different from Before?

### Previous Investigation
- We thought the game was stuck because of missing kernel functions
- We implemented many Nt*, Ke*, Rtl*, Ex* functions
- We fixed the VBlank pump
- We implemented the streaming bridge

### Current State
- All those fixes are working correctly
- But the game is STILL stuck in the same sleep loop
- The problem is NOT missing kernel functions
- The problem is NOT file loading
- The problem is NOT PM4 parsing

## Hypothesis: What's the Game Waiting For?

Based on the evidence, the game is likely waiting for ONE of these:

### 1. Resource Loading Complete (MOST LIKELY)
- Game loaded 4 MB of GLOBALMEMORYFILE.BIN
- But the file is 6 MB total
- Game may be waiting for the full file to load
- OR waiting for additional files to load
- Streaming system may be stalled

### 2. Thread Synchronization
- Game may be waiting for a worker thread to signal completion
- Worker thread may be stuck or not running
- Check if all expected threads are created and running

### 3. Graphics Initialization Event
- Game may be waiting for a GPU initialization event
- Some Vd* function may need to signal completion
- Check if VdInitializeEngines needs to trigger a callback

### 4. Game Logic Bug
- Recompiler bug causing incorrect control flow
- Game skipping initialization code
- Would require deep debugging with IDA

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Priority Order)

1. **Check File Loading Completion**
   - Verify if game is waiting for more file data
   - Check if streaming bridge is signaling completion correctly
   - Look for file I/O requests that are being ignored

2. **Check Thread States**
   - Verify all expected threads are created
   - Check if worker threads are running or blocked
   - Compare thread count with Xenia (we have 3, Xenia has 9)

3. **Check Graphics Initialization**
   - Verify VdInitializeEngines is complete
   - Check if game is waiting for a graphics callback
   - Look for missing Vd* function calls

4. **Deep Debugging**
   - Use IDA to decompile function at 0x8262F300
   - Understand what condition the game is waiting for
   - Check memory at r5=0x2B9250 to see what's being polled

### Diagnostic Commands

```powershell
# Check file loading status
Get-Content mw05_host_trace.log | Select-String "StreamBridge|NtReadFile"

# Check thread creation
Get-Content mw05_host_trace.log | Select-String "ExCreateThread|Thread.*created"

# Check graphics initialization
Get-Content mw05_host_trace.log | Select-String "VdInitialize|VdEnable"

# Decompile sleep loop function
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'http://127.0.0.1:5050/decompile?ea=0x8262F300'
```

## Conclusion

**The game is functionally identical to our previous state - stuck in the same sleep loop at 0x8262F300.**

All our infrastructure is working:
- ✅ PM4 parser
- ✅ Ring buffer
- ✅ File loading
- ✅ VBlank pump
- ✅ Graphics initialization

But the game logic is stuck waiting for something. We need to:
1. Identify WHAT the game is waiting for (use IDA to decompile 0x8262F300)
2. Determine WHY that condition never becomes true
3. Fix the root cause (likely missing file data, thread, or event)

**This is NOT a rendering bug - it's an initialization/synchronization bug.**
