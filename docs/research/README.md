# Research Archive (Migrated)

This folder contains legacy, long-form research notes produced during active debugging.

As of 2025-10-21, documentation is consolidated in the project Wiki (see docs/wiki/ for source pages and the GitHub Wiki once published).

## Where to read now
- docs/wiki/Home.md — entry point
- docs/wiki/Current-Status.md — up-to-date status
- docs/wiki/Rendering-Progress.md — PM4/VdSwap/no-draws
- docs/wiki/Debugging-Guide.md — console/env-vars/CDB
- docs/wiki/Threads-and-Synchronization.md — thread fixes
- docs/wiki/Logging-and-Traces.md — log locations & cleanup
- docs/wiki/Scripts-and-Tooling.md — consolidation & publishing

## What remains here
- Time-stamped investigations (kept for provenance)
- Deep dives and raw logs referenced by Wiki pages

Prefer updating the Wiki pages; add links here only when necessary.
