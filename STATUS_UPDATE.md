# MW05 Recomp - Status Update

## Executive Summary

**MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH ACHIEVED!** XEX import table processing is now fully functional. The game can call kernel functions, graphics initialization is working, and callbacks are being invoked. We've gone from 0% to 45% import coverage.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. XEX Import Table Processing (Main Achievement)

**Problem**: The game couldn't call any kernel functions because the XEX import table wasn't being processed after module load.

**Solution**: Implemented complete import table processing in `Mw05Recomp/main.cpp`:
- Reads XEX import table structure from `XEX_HEADER_IMPORT_LIBRARIES`
- Parses string table with null-terminated, 4-byte padded library names
- Resolves ordinals to function names using `XamExports` and `XboxKernelExports` tables
- Assigns unique guest addresses to each import (starting at 0x828CA000)
- Patches thunk entries with guest addresses (big-endian format)
- Registers functions in lookup table using `g_memory.InsertFunction()`

**Results**:
- ✅ 324/719 imports (45%) successfully patched
- ✅ All critical Vd* graphics functions working
- ✅ Game can now call kernel functions

### 2. Auto-Generated Import Lookup Table

**Problem**: Manually maintaining a lookup table for 197 `__imp__` functions was error-prone.

**Solution**: Created `tools/generate_import_lookup.py`:
- Parses `Mw05Recomp/kernel/imports.cpp` to find all `GUEST_FUNCTION_HOOK` declarations
- Generates `Mw05Recomp/kernel/import_lookup.cpp` with all necessary declarations
- Creates lookup table mapping function names to their addresses
- Found 197 unique `__imp__` functions

**Results**:
- ✅ Automated import lookup table generation
- ✅ All 197 implemented functions now available to the game
- ✅ Easy to maintain and update

### 3. Game Progress

**Before**:
- Black screen
- No kernel function calls
- Main thread stuck waiting for graphics init

**After**:
- Graphics initialization working
- 6734 graphics callbacks invoked in 60 seconds
- PM4 command buffer scanning active
- Game is running and progressing

## Current Status

### ✅ Working Features

1. **VBlank Pump**: Generating vertical blank interrupts (fixed in previous iteration)
2. **Import Table Processing**: 324/719 imports (45%) patched and callable
3. **Graphics Initialization**: `VdInitializeEngines` being called successfully
4. **Graphics Callbacks**: 6734 callbacks invoked, game naturally registered callback at 0x825979A8
5. **PM4 Scanning**: Command buffer scanning active (2 scans in 60 seconds)

### ⚠️ Current Limitations

1. **No Draw Commands**: PM4 scans show `draws=0`, game hasn't issued draw commands yet
2. **395 Missing Imports**: 204 unique missing imports still need to be implemented
3. **Limited PM4 Activity**: Only 2 PM4 scans in 60 seconds suggests game might be stuck

## Missing Imports Analysis

Total missing import calls: 395
Unique missing imports: 204

### By Category:

1. **NetDll** (73 functions) - Networking, probably not critical for initial rendering
   - WSA* socket functions
   - XNet* networking functions
   
2. **Xam** (47 functions) - Xbox Application Model, some might be important
   - Content management (XamContent*)
   - Session management (XamSession*)
   - UI functions (XamShow*)

3. **XMA** (20 functions) - Audio codec, not critical for rendering
   - XMAInitializeContext
   - XMASetInputBuffer*
   - XMASetOutputBuffer*

4. **Nt** (17 functions) - NT kernel functions, **THESE MIGHT BE CRITICAL!**
   - NtCreateFile, NtOpenFile, NtReadFile, NtWriteFile, NtClose
   - NtCreateTimer, NtSetTimerEx, NtCancelTimer
   - NtCreateMutant, NtReleaseMutant
   - NtCreateIoCompletion, NtRemoveIoCompletion, NtSetIoCompletion
   - NtPulseEvent, NtQueueApcThread
   - NtSignalAndWaitForSingleObjectEx, NtYieldExecution

5. **XeCrypt** (12 functions) - Cryptography, probably not critical
6. **Ex**, **Ke**, **Vd**, **Ob**, **Mm** - Various kernel functions

### Priority for Implementation

**High Priority** (likely blocking game progression):
- Nt* file I/O functions (NtCreateFile, NtOpenFile, NtReadFile, NtWriteFile, NtClose)
- Nt* synchronization functions (NtCreateMutant, NtReleaseMutant, NtPulseEvent)
- Nt* timer functions (NtCreateTimer, NtSetTimerEx, NtCancelTimer)
- Nt* I/O completion functions (NtCreateIoCompletion, NtRemoveIoCompletion, NtSetIoCompletion)

**Medium Priority** (might be needed):
- Xam* content management functions
- Ex* memory allocation functions
- Vd* additional graphics functions

**Low Priority** (probably not needed for initial rendering):
- NetDll* networking functions
- XMA* audio codec functions
- XeCrypt* cryptography functions

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. **Implement Critical Nt* Functions**:
   - Add stubs for the 17 missing Nt* functions
   - Focus on file I/O, timers, and synchronization primitives
   - These are likely blocking the game from progressing

2. **Monitor Game State**:
   - Run the game for longer periods (2-5 minutes)
   - Check if PM4 scan frequency increases
   - Look for any error messages or patterns

3. **Investigate Why Game Is Stuck**:
   - Check if the game is waiting for specific imports
   - Look for any blocking calls or infinite loops
   - Verify that all game threads are running

### Long-Term Goals

1. **Implement Remaining Imports**:
   - Add the missing 395 imports (prioritize by category)
   - Use stub implementations that return success/default values
   - Identify which stubs are actually being called

2. **Get Draws Appearing**:
   - Continue monitoring PM4 scans for draw commands
   - Investigate why the game isn't issuing draws yet
   - Check if any resources or initialization steps are missing

3. **Optimize Performance**:
   - Profile the import lookup performance
   - Optimize hot paths in kernel function implementations
   - Reduce overhead in graphics callback invocations

## Technical Details

### Import Table Structure

```
XEX Import Table (719 total imports):
├── xam.xex (346 imports)
│   ├── 173 patched (50%)
│   └── 173 missing (50%)
└── xboxkrnl.exe (373 imports)
    ├── 151 patched (40%)
    └── 222 missing (60%)
```

### Guest Address Assignment

Imports are assigned sequential guest addresses starting at `0x828CA000`:
- Each import gets a unique 4-byte aligned address
- Addresses are registered in the function lookup table
- Thunk entries are patched with these addresses

### How It Works

1. **Import Table Reading**:
   - Parse `XEX_HEADER_IMPORT_LIBRARIES` from XEX optional headers
   - Build string table from null-terminated, 4-byte padded library names
   - Iterate through each library's import descriptors

2. **Ordinal Resolution**:
   - Look up function name from ordinal using export tables
   - `XamExports` for xam.xex functions
   - `XboxKernelExports` for xboxkrnl.exe functions

3. **Function Lookup**:
   - Call `GetImportFunctionByName()` to get `__imp__` function pointer
   - Auto-generated lookup table maps names to addresses

4. **Thunk Patching**:
   - Assign unique guest address to import
   - Register function at guest address using `g_memory.InsertFunction()`
   - Patch thunk entry with guest address (big-endian)

5. **Function Invocation**:
   - Game code calls import via `PPC_CALL_INDIRECT_FUNC(address)`
   - Lookup function pointer using `PPC_LOOKUP_FUNC(base, target)`
   - Call the `__imp__` function with PPC context

## Conclusion

The import table patching is a **major milestone**! We've gone from a completely broken state (black screen, no kernel calls) to a partially working state (graphics init, callbacks, PM4 scanning). The game is now much closer to rendering.

The next critical step is to implement the missing Nt* kernel functions, particularly file I/O, timers, and synchronization primitives. These are likely blocking the game from progressing to the point where it issues draw commands.

**Progress**: 0% → 45% import coverage, graphics initialization working, 6734 callbacks invoked
**Next Goal**: Implement critical Nt* functions to unblock game progression and get draws appearing
