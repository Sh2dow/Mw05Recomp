# Rendering Status - 2025-10-16

## Summary
✅ **THREAD CRASH FIXED!** The game now runs without crashing and the main loop is executing.
⚠️ **NO DRAWS YET** - The game is not issuing any draw commands.

## Current Status

### ✅ Working Components
1. **Game Execution** - Game runs for 5+ seconds without crashing
2. **Main Loop** - Main loop is running (`[MAIN-LOOP] Iteration #4`, `#5`)
3. **Present Calls** - Present is being called (`[PRESENT] Call #4`, `#5`)
4. **Command Lists** - Command lists are being created (`BeginCommandList called: count=3`)
5. **PM4 Processing** - PM4 commands are being processed (`PM4_ScanLinear result: consumed=76968`)
6. **Event Signaling** - Events are being signaled (`[ke.set] obj=0x40009D4C`)
7. **Graphics Callback** - VD ISR callback is being invoked (`[GFX-CB] Call #0`, `#1`, `#2`, `#3`)
8. **Import Table** - 388/719 imports (54%) successfully patched

### ⚠️ Issues
1. **NO DRAW COMMANDS** - All PM4 scans show `draws=0`
2. **Only TYPE0 Packets** - PM4 parser only sees TYPE0 (register write) packets, not TYPE3 (command) packets
3. **No DRAW_INDX** - No `PM4_DRAW_INDX` (0x22) or `PM4_DRAW_INDX_2` (0x36) opcodes detected
4. **Missing Imports** - 331 imports still not implemented (mostly NetDll, Xam, XMA)

## PM4 Packet Analysis

### Opcodes Seen
- **Opcode 0x03** - Seen multiple times (TYPE0 register write, not a draw command)
- **NO draw opcodes** - No 0x22 (DRAW_INDX) or 0x36 (DRAW_INDX_2) seen

### Expected Draw Opcodes
```cpp
PM4_DRAW_INDX = 0x22,           // Draw indexed primitives
PM4_DRAW_INDX_2 = 0x36,         // Draw indexed primitives (variant)
```

### PM4 Packet Types
```cpp
PM4_TYPE0 = 0,  // Register write (what we're seeing)
PM4_TYPE1 = 1,  // Reserved
PM4_TYPE2 = 2,  // Reserved
PM4_TYPE3 = 3   // Command packet (what we need for draws)
```

## Comparison with Xenia

### Xenia (Working)
- Line 317731: **First draw command issued!**
- Game progresses through initialization and starts rendering
- Draw commands appear after ~150,000 sleep calls

### Our Implementation (Current)
- Game runs main loop and calls Present
- PM4 commands are being processed
- But NO draw commands are being issued
- Game appears to be stuck in a state where it's not ready to render

## Possible Causes

### 1. Missing Resources
- Game may be waiting for resources to load
- File I/O may not be working correctly
- Textures/shaders may not be loaded

### 2. Missing Initialization
- Some graphics initialization step may be missing
- GPU state may not be set up correctly
- Render targets may not be configured

### 3. Missing Threads
- Xenia creates 9 threads, we only create 3
- Missing threads may be responsible for issuing draw commands
- Worker threads may not be running correctly

### 4. Missing Imports
- 331 imports are still not implemented
- Some critical import may be blocking rendering
- XMA/Audio imports may be required for game progression

### 5. Game State
- Game may be stuck in a loading screen or menu
- Game may be waiting for user input
- Game may be in an error state

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Check file I/O** - Verify that the game can load resources
2. **Check thread creation** - Ensure all required threads are being created
3. **Check missing imports** - Implement critical missing imports
4. **Check game state** - Determine what state the game is in

### Investigation
1. **Compare with Xenia** - Analyze Xenia's execution to see what happens before first draw
2. **Trace PM4 commands** - Enable PM4 tracing to see what commands are being issued
3. **Check GPU state** - Verify that GPU registers are being set correctly
4. **Check render targets** - Verify that render targets are configured

### Long-term
1. **Implement missing imports** - Add the remaining 331 imports
2. **Implement missing threads** - Create the missing 6 threads
3. **Implement file I/O** - Ensure file loading works correctly
4. **Implement audio** - Add XMA decoder and audio worker threads

## Environment Variables

Current environment variables (from `run_with_debug.ps1`):
```powershell
$env:MW05_FAST_BOOT = "1"                          # Fast boot to skip delays
$env:MW05_UNBLOCK_MAIN = "1"                       # Unblock main thread (WORKING)
$env:MW05_BREAK_82813514 = "1"                     # Break worker thread loop (WORKING)
$env:MW05_BREAK_WAIT_LOOP = "1"                    # Break wait loop
$env:MW05_FORCE_PRESENT = "1"                      # Force host to present frames
$env:MW05_FORCE_GFX_NOTIFY_CB = "1"                # Force graphics callback registration
$env:MW05_FORCE_GFX_NOTIFY_CB_CTX = "0x40007180"   # Graphics callback context address
$env:MW05_FORCE_GFX_NOTIFY_CB_DELAY_TICKS = "350"  # Delay before forcing callback
```

## Diagnostic Commands
```powershell
# Build and test
./build_cmd.ps1 -Stage app
./scripts/run_5sec.ps1

# Check PM4 opcodes
Get-Content Traces/test_trace.log | Select-String 'HOST.PM4.OPC'

# Check draw commands
Get-Content Traces/test_trace.log | Select-String 'DRAW'

# Check file I/O
Get-Content Traces/test_trace.log | Select-String 'NtCreateFile|NtOpenFile|NtReadFile'
```

## Conclusion

The game is now running without crashing, which is a major milestone! However, it's not yet issuing draw commands. The next step is to investigate why the game is not progressing to the rendering stage. This likely involves:

1. Implementing missing imports (especially file I/O and audio)
2. Creating missing threads
3. Ensuring resources can be loaded
4. Debugging the game state to see what it's waiting for

The fact that the game is running the main loop and calling Present is a good sign - it means the basic infrastructure is working. We just need to figure out what's blocking the game from issuing draw commands.
