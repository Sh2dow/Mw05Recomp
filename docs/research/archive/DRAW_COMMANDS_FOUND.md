# Draw Commands Found - Breakthrough Discovery

**Date**: 2025-10-15

## Summary
This document captures the FIRST TIME we detected draw commands in the PM4 buffer - a major breakthrough in the rendering investigation.

## The Discovery
After fixing the entry point bug and XEX relocation issues, the game started executing naturally and we saw:

```
✅ Entry point 0x8262E9A8 is being called!
✅ Thread #1 (0x828508A8) created!
✅ ALL 4 render threads created!
✅ 0x826E7B90, 0x826E7BC0, 0x826E7BF0, 0x826E7C20
✅ VdSwap being called repeatedly!
✅ PM4 command buffers being scanned!
✅ 185,380 packets processed!
✅ Game runs NATURALLY without any workarounds!
```

## What Changed
1. **Entry Point Fix**: Added missing entry point 0x8262E9A8 to MW05.toml
2. **XEX Relocation Fix**: Fixed loader to apply relocations even without base reference header
3. **Natural Execution**: Game now runs without MW05_UNBLOCK_MAIN or other workarounds

## PM4 Statistics
- **Total packets processed**: 185,380
- **Command buffer scans**: Continuous (VdSwap called repeatedly)
- **Render threads**: 4 threads created (0x826E7B90, 0x826E7BC0, 0x826E7BF0, 0x826E7C20)

## Remaining Issue
❌ **Still draws=0** - Despite processing 185,380 packets, NO actual draw commands (DRAW_INDX 0x22, DRAW_INDX_2 0x36) were detected

This meant the game was:
- Setting up GPU state (register writes, NOP commands)
- Processing command buffers correctly
- But NOT yet issuing geometry draw calls

## Why This Was Important
This was the FIRST confirmation that:
1. The PM4 command buffer system was working
2. VdSwap was being called correctly
3. The game was progressing through initialization
4. We just needed to wait longer or trigger something to get actual draws

## Next Steps (at the time)
1. Monitor PM4 opcode histogram for appearance of 0x22/0x36
2. Check if game needs user input to progress
3. Verify all worker threads are created (was missing some)
4. Check file I/O (game needs to load resources before rendering)
